# Text OCR/ PDF-to-Word Convert

<p> In this project, I prepared some scripts for a client to convert their PDF files into readable word files and then making a search engine based on that. </p>

<p> You can find some scripts in Python in which I made it possible to look for a specific word in a PDF file, count the times the word appear in a PDF file, and merge thousands of pdf files to search a word in it </p>

<p> If you want to make a project of this type, please feel free to reach to me. </p>
